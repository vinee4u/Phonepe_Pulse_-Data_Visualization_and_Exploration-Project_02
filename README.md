Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration:
A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly

Using Github Cloning, Python, Pandas, MySQL,mysql-connector-python, Streamlit, and Plotly.

Skills Gained from this Project:
Data extraction and processing: learned how to use Clone Github to extract data from a repository and pre-process the data using Python libraries such as Pandas.
Database management:learned how to use a relational database such as MySQL to store data and retrieve it efficiently for analysis and visualization.
Visualization and dashboard creation: learned how to use libraries such as Streamlit and Plotly to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards for data visualization.
Geo visualization: learned how to create and display data on a map using Plotly's built-in geo map functions.
Dynamic updating: learned how to create a dashboard that dynamically updates based on the latest data in a database.
Project development and deployment: learned how to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly solution, from data extraction to dashboard deployment. You will also learn how to test and deploy the solution to ensure it is secure, efficient, and user-friendly.
